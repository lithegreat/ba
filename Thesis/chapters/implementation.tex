\section{XML Parser}

As mentioned in the previous section, OpenASIP uses XML to define the properties and semantics of custom operations.
To translate these operations into CoreDSL, we need to parse the XML representation and extract the necessary information.
We developed an XML parser based on pandas package in Python to read the XML files and extract the operation details.
