This paper evaluates custom operations from the OpenASIP 2.0 Co-Design toolchain using the Extendable Translating Instruction Set Simulator (ETISS) within the CoreDSL ecosystem. We collected and translated OpenASIP custom operations into CoreDSL syntax, generated ETISS architectures, and benchmarked the performance of these custom instructions. The results show that the custom operations can improve the performance based on MLonMCU benchmarks with a moderate speedup on average compared to the baseline.
