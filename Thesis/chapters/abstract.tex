This thesis evaluates the integration and performance improvement of custom operations designed using the OpenASIP 2.0 Co-Design toolchain within the CoreDSL ecosystem, leveraging the Extendable Translating Instruction Set Simulator (ETISS). As hardware-software co-design becomes increasingly crucial in the optimization of modern embedded systems, custom instructions tailored to specific applications can significantly enhance performance. This research systematically collected and translated OpenASIP-defined custom operations into CoreDSL syntax to create a pipeline for generating ETISS-compatible architectures. These architectures were evaluated against a series of benchmarks using the MLonMCU framework, a tool designed for benchmarking machine learning workloads on microcontrollers. In this study, we delve into the intricacies of translating complex custom operations and the corresponding challenges within the CoreDSL environment, examining the effectiveness of ETISS in simulating these architectures. Through comprehensive benchmarking, we demonstrate that custom instructions, when effectively integrated, can yield moderate performance improvements over the baseline, reflecting the potential of custom operations in enhancing application-specific workloads.
