\section{Existing Solutions and Approaches}

\begin{enumerate}

    \item \textbf{RISC-V ISA Extensions:}
    The RISC-V instruction set architecture (ISA) has gained significant traction due to its open-source and modular design, allowing extensive customization.
    Recent research has provided a survey of RISC-V ISA extensions, covering various improvements and customizations aimed at enhancing processor performance and capabilities \cite{Risc-v}.

    \item \textbf{ETISS (Extendable Translating Instruction Set Simulator):}
    ETISS \cite{ETISS} is a prominent tool for instruction set simulation, enabling detailed modeling and evaluation of custom processor architectures.
    It supports functional and performance simulations but is designed to work with CoreDSL-based instruction sets. Integrating custom instructions from other formats poses challenges.

    \item \textbf{OpenASIP 2.0:}
    OpenASIP 2.0 \cite{OpenASIP} is a co-design toolset for customizing RISC-V processors, providing features for RTL generation and programming of custom instructions.
    While effective for defining and validating custom instructions, it lacks direct support for integration with ETISS, which uses CoreDSL for instruction definitions.

    \item \textbf{CoreDSL:}
    CoreDSL \cite{CoreDSL} is a descriptive language for hardware design, including custom instructions.
    It facilitates clear and flexible instruction set specification but requires additional steps for integration into simulation tools like ETISS.

\end{enumerate}

\section{Limitations of Existing Approaches}

\begin{enumerate}

    \item \textbf{Instruction Set Compatibility:}
    There is a lack of compatibility between OpenASIP's custom instruction sets and the CoreDSL-based instruction sets used by ETISS.
    The process of translating and integrating these custom instructions into ETISS is complex and requires manual effort.

    \item \textbf{Integration Complexity:}
    Existing tools do not provide a streamlined method for converting OpenASIP's custom instructions into CoreDSL format.
    This complexity limits the effectiveness of integrating these instructions into ETISS.

    \item \textbf{Tool Limitations:}
    While ETISS and OpenASIP 2.0 offer powerful functionalities, their integration capabilities are limited.
    ETISS does not support direct integration with custom instructions defined outside of CoreDSL, and OpenASIP 2.0 lacks built-in mechanisms for translating these instructions.

\end{enumerate}

\section{Gap in the State-of-the-Art}

The primary gap in the current state-of-the-art is the lack of a streamlined, automated method for translating and integrating OpenASIP's custom instructions into ETISS,
which uses CoreDSL-based instruction sets. Specifically:

\begin{enumerate}

    \item \textbf{Translation Methodology:}
    There is no established methodology for efficiently converting OpenASIP's custom instructions into CoreDSL format.
    This gap hinders the seamless integration of custom instructions across different formats.

    \item \textbf{Automated Integration:}
    Existing tools do not support automated integration of custom instruction sets across different formats.
    This limitation increases manual effort and complexity, making it challenging to leverage OpenASIP's custom instructions within ETISS.

\end{enumerate}

\section{Proposed Approach and Its Contribution}

Our proposed approach addresses these gaps by:

\begin{enumerate}

    \item \textbf{Developing a Translation Methodology:}
    We propose a systematic methodology for translating OpenASIP's custom instruction sets into CoreDSL syntax, facilitating integration with ETISS.

    \item \textbf{Enhancing Integration:}
    By converting OpenASIP instructions into a CoreDSL-compatible format, we enable seamless integration with ETISS for effective simulation.

    \item \textbf{Streamlining the Workflow:}
    Our approach reduces manual effort and improves efficiency, making it easier to leverage OpenASIP's custom instructions within ETISS.

\end{enumerate}

In summary, our research provides a novel solution for bridging the gap between OpenASIP's custom instructions and ETISS's CoreDSL-based instruction sets,
advancing the capabilities of simulation and customization tools.
